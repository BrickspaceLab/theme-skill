## When to use

Use when the task involves Shopify **JSON templates** under `templates/` (e.g. `product.json`, `index.json`, alternates like `page.contact.json`), or **section JSON** that references **theme blocks** from `blocks/` in block-based themes.

**This skill alone does not fully cover:**

- `config/settings_schema.json` or `config/settings_data.json` (global theme settings)
- Checkout branding or Checkout UI extensions
- Theme app extension code under `extensions/`
- Replacing **Liquid** `.liquid` templates where the theme has not adopted JSON for that route

If the theme uses a **build step** that generates `sections/` or `blocks/`, read that theme’s README and follow its source-of-truth paths before editing compiled output.

## Quick start

1. **Understand requirements** — Parse prompts or images for layout, columns/rows, content types, and styling (see **Design images and mockups** when the input is visual).
2. **Discover allowed block types** — List `blocks/` and read parent `{% schema %}` so every `type` you use exists in this theme (required; see below).
3. **(Optional) Check bundled examples** — If `examples/` is present, follow **Choosing the best example to reference** in [examples/README.md](examples/README.md): compare the workspace theme to each indexed example and open at most one best-matched file. If nothing fits, copy patterns from existing `templates/*.json` in the workspace theme instead. Never emit `type` strings from a bundled example until they appear in the target theme’s allowed set.
4. **Map to real blocks** — Choose types only from that allowed set; resolve section `type` from `sections/*.liquid` for template-level JSON.
5. **Analyze schemas** — Read each block or section `{% schema %}` for allowed children, setting IDs, types, defaults, and presets.
6. **Compile JSON** — Build valid `sections`, nested `blocks`, and `order` / `block_order` arrays per Shopify’s template structure.
7. **Validate** — Run the checklist below before finishing.

## Workflow

### Step 1 — Understand user requirements

**From text:**

- Layout: grid, flex, slider, inline, etc.
- Column/row counts
- Content: images, buttons, text, product cards, etc.
- Styling: spacing, colors, responsive behavior

**From images:**

- Visual layout, columns and rows, elements and relationships, spacing and alignment
- Visual hierarchy (headline vs body vs CTAs), approximate alignment (left/center/right), and content categories (hero, cards, logos, footer, etc.)
- **What is ambiguous** — Exact breakpoints, font sizes, and pixel spacing are not reliably readable from a static image; call that out instead of guessing.

**Design images and mockups**

When the user provides a screenshot, Figma export, or design mockup:

- **Extract:** structure (sections, columns, stacking order), content types, and qualitative spacing rhythm (tight vs airy), not exact pixel values unless provided separately.
- **Do not infer** concrete Shopify `type` strings, setting keys, or enum values from the image alone. **Always** reconcile with **Discover allowed block types** on the target theme.
- **Limits:** JSON templates do not express every visual detail. Arbitrary typography, one-off CSS, or global palette changes may require **theme settings**, **section settings**, or **custom CSS** outside the core JSON-template workflow—say so when the design cannot be matched with schema-defined settings only.
- If the design **cannot** be built with the theme’s available blocks and settings, **state the gap** and offer the closest achievable structure.

### Step 2 — Discover allowed block types

Do this **before** naming or emitting any `type` in JSON. This is the operational way to satisfy the validation rule that every `type` exists in the theme.

1. **List** files in `blocks/` — For themes using theme blocks, the basename of `blocks/<name>.liquid` is typically a valid block `type` (confirm in schema).
2. **Read** `{% schema %}` on each **section** you add or edit in the template, and on each **block** file you nest. Collect every block `type` the parent allows (specific types, `@theme`, `@app`, etc., per Shopify rules for that parent).
3. **Build the allowed set** — Union of: types from `blocks/` that the parent schema permits, types declared in the parent’s `blocks` array, and section `type` values from `sections/<type>.liquid` for template-level `sections`.
4. **Only use types in that set.** If the user asks for a layout that no block provides, propose the **closest real types**, copy a working template in the same theme, or note that **adding a new block** is theme development work outside JSON-only edits.

### Step 3 — Check bundled examples (optional)

If `examples/` is present in this skill package, follow **Choosing the best example to reference** in [examples/README.md](examples/README.md):

- Compare the workspace theme to each indexed example (theme name, README, overlap between `blocks/` basenames and the example’s described types).
- Open **at most one** best-matched file for patterns and sample JSON.
- If nothing fits, copy patterns from existing `templates/*.json` in the workspace theme instead.
- **Never** emit `type` strings from a bundled example until they appear in the target theme’s allowed set.

### Step 4 — Map requirements to real blocks

Within the **allowed type set** from Step 2:

- Search the theme’s `blocks/` directory and section schemas for blocks that match the layout and content needs.
- For **template-level** sections, list `sections/` and map JSON `type` to section files (usually basename of `sections/<type>.liquid`).

### Step 5 — Analyze block and section schemas

For each block or section, read `{% schema %}`:

1. **Nested blocks** — `"blocks": [{ "type": "@theme" }]` vs specific types vs `"blocks": []`.
2. **Settings** — Required vs optional, defaults, types (range, select, checkbox, etc.).
3. **Presets** — Recommended configurations.

### Step 6 — Compile JSON structure

Follow Shopify’s JSON template shape. If the theme ships **Cursor rules** (e.g. `.cursor/rules/templates.mdc`, `blocks.mdc`, `schemas.mdc`), follow those for the project you are editing.

**Template structure:**

```json
{
  "sections": {
    "<sectionId>": {
      "type": "<sectionType>",
      "settings": {},
      "blocks": {
        "<blockId>": {
          "type": "<blockType>",
          "name": "t:blocks.block_name",
          "settings": {},
          "blocks": {},
          "block_order": []
        }
      },
      "block_order": ["<blockId>"]
    }
  },
  "order": ["<sectionId>"]
}
```

**Block instance IDs:**

- Use descriptive prefixes that reflect role (e.g. layout, container, item, image, text)—match conventions you see in the theme’s existing JSON.
- Append a short unique suffix if needed.
- Keep IDs unique within the template (and within each nested `blocks` scope per schema rules).

**Settings (block-based themes):**

- Grids often use `row_desktop`, `row_mobile`, `gap_size`, `enable_x_padding` — **only if** those keys exist in the target schema.
- Prefer translation keys for block `name` when the theme does: e.g. `"t:blocks.image"`.
- Align `color_scheme` and spacing with the theme’s design system.

### Step 7 — Validate

Run the **Validation checklist** below before finishing.

- JSON is valid
- Section and block instance IDs are unique in scope
- Every `block_order` matches the keys in its sibling `blocks` object
- Top-level `order` lists every section key to render
- Each `type` exists in `sections/` or `blocks/` and is allowed by the parent schema
- Nested block types are valid for the parent
- Setting keys and value types match `{% schema %}`
