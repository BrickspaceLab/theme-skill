# theme builder

Theme Builder is a skill for **designers and developers** who work in **Shopify Online Store 2.0** themes and want the agent to ship real structure—not invented block names or settings that do not exist in the theme you are editing.

Install:

```bash
npx skills add BrickspaceLab/theme-builder
```

The skill covers **JSON templates** (`templates/*.json`), **theme blocks** and section JSON, **Liquid `{% schema %}`** alignment, **discovery-first** workflows so types always match `blocks/` and `sections/` on disk, **design mockups** (what to infer vs what to verify in schema), and optional **bundled examples** for themes documented under [`examples/`](examples/).

Use it **on a case-by-case basis** rather than everywhere. Good moments: editing or adding a JSON template, wiring nested blocks to match a layout, reconciling a Figma or screenshot with what your theme actually exposes, or reviewing template JSON before commit.

This skill is the **focused layer** on top of Shopify’s platform. For filenames, limits, and official docs links, see [`reference/shopify-json.md`](reference/shopify-json.md) and the [Shopify theme docs](https://shopify.dev/docs/storefronts/themes).

### Scope

- **In scope:** JSON templates under `templates/`, section `type` / block `type` strings that exist in **that** theme, settings keys defined in section and block schemas, blocks under `blocks/` when the theme uses them.
- **Out of scope:** **Writing or editing custom Liquid** (sections, blocks, snippets, layouts—anything outside assembling JSON and reading `{% schema %}` for types and settings). Also out of scope: store credentials, `config/settings_data.json` theme-setup flows (unless you extend the skill), Checkout UI extensions, Theme app extension bundles.
